## üì± The Problem We're Solving

As frequent travelers, we've all experienced this: You meet amazing people on your adventures, exchange contacts with promises to "meet up if you're ever in my city." Months later, when you're in Napa Valley, you completely forget who you know there. Their contact sits unnamed in your phone, their Instagram handle is forgotten, and meaningful connections fade into digital noise.

Meanwhile, your travels - the experiences that define you - are scattered across hundreds of unorganized photos that are too overwhelming to curate and share.

## ‚ú® How TravelPact Changes Everything
TravelPact is the travel companion every explorer needs, built around three core innovations:

### üåç Intelligent Connection Mapping
- **Phone-based contact sync** - Track connections by phone numbers for automatic profile linking
- **Location-aware networking** - Remember who you know in every city
- **Connection visualization** - See your global network mapped on an interactive 3D globe

### üì∏ Automated Travel History
- **Smart photo analysis** - Automatically build your travel timeline from existing photos
- **EXIF metadata processing** - Extract location and timestamp data to create waypoints
- **Effortless organization** - No manual data entry required

### ü§ù Social Travel Pacts
- **Live travel sharing** - Create "pacts" to share real-time location and media with travel companions
- **Collaborative media** - Solve the eternal problem of collecting photos from group trips
